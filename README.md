# Kubernetes in Codespaces

> Setup a Kubernetes cluster using `k3d` running in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Overview

This is a template that will setup a Kubernetes developer cluster using `k3d` in a `GitHub Codespace` or local `Dev Container`

We use this for `inner-loop` Kubernetes development. Note that it is not appropriate for production use but is a great `Developer Experience`. Feedback calls the approach `game-changing` - we hope you agree!

For ideas, feature requests, and discussions, please use GitHub discussions so we can collaborate and follow up.

This Codespace is tested with `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` - it "should" work with bash but hasn't been fully tested. For the HoL, please use zsh to avoid any issues.

You can run the `dev container` locally and you can also connect to the Codespace with a local version of VS Code.

Please experiment and add any issues to the GitHub Discussion. We LOVE PRs!

The motivation for creating and using Codespaces is highlighted by this [GitHub Blog Post](https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/). "It eliminated the fragility and single-track model of local development environments, but it also gave us a powerful new point of leverage for improving GitHubâ€™s developer experience."

Cory Wilkerson, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, recorded a podcast where he shared the GitHub journey to [Codespaces](https://changelog.com/podcast/459)

## Open with Codespaces

> You must be a member of the Microsoft OSS and CSE-Labs GitHub organizations

- Instructions for joining the GitHub orgs are [here](https://github.com/cse-labs/moss)
  - If you don't see an `Open in Codespaces` option, you are not part of the organization(s)

- Click the `Code` button on this repo
- Click the `Codespaces` tab
- Click `New Codespace`
- Choose the `4 core` option

![Create Codespace](./images/OpenWithCodespaces.jpg)

## Open Workspace

> Wait until the Codespace is ready before opening the workspace

- Once setup is complete, open the workspace
  - Click the `hamburger` menu
  - Click `File`
  - Click `Open Workspace from file`
  - Click `workspaces`
  - Click `cse-labs.code-workspace`
- Your screen will reload
  - You may have to click on the terminal tab once Codespaces reloads

## Stopping a Codespace

- Codespaces will shutdown automatically after 30 minutes of non-use
- To shutdown a codespace immediately
  - Click `Codespaces` in the lower left of the browser window
  - Choose `Stop Current Codespace` from the context menu

- You can also rebuild the container that is running your Codespace
  - Any changes in `/workspaces` will be retained
  - Other directories will be reset
  - Click `Codespaces` in the lower left of the browser window
  - Choose `Rebuild Container` from the context menu
  - Confirm your choice

- To delete a Codespace
  - <https://github.com/codespaces>
  - Use the context menu to delete the Codespace

## Build and Deploy a k3d Cluster

- This will create a local Kubernetes cluster using k3d
  - The cluster is running inside your Codespace

  ```bash

  # build the cluster
  make all

  ```

- Output from `make all` should resemble this

  ```text

  default      jumpbox                                   1/1   Running   0   25s
  default      ngsa-memory                               1/1   Running   0   33s
  default      webv                                      1/1   Running   0   31s
  logging      fluentbit                                 1/1   Running   0   31s
  monitoring   grafana-64f7dbcf96-cfmtd                  1/1   Running   0   32s
  monitoring   prometheus-deployment-67cbf97f84-tjxm7    1/1   Running   0   32s

  ```

## Validate Deployment

- If you get an error, just run the command again - it will clear once the services are ready

```bash

# check endpoints
make check

```

## Validate deployment with k9s

- From the Codespace terminal window, start `k9s`
  - Type `k9s` and press enter
  - Press `0` to select all namespaces
  - Wait for all pods to be in the `Running` state (look for the `STATUS` column)
  - Use the arrow key to select `nsga-memory` then press the `l` key to view logs from the pod
  - To go back, press the `esc` key
  - Use the arrow key to select `jumpbox` then press `s` key to open a shell in the container
    - Hit the `ngsa-memory` NodePort from within the cluster by executing `http ngsa-memory:8080/version`
    - Verify 200 status in the response
    - To exit - `exit`
  - To view other deployed resources - press `shift + :` followed by the deployment type (e.g. `secret`, `services`, `deployment`, etc).
  - To exit - `:q <enter>`

### Other interesting endpoints

Open [curl.http](./curl.http)

> [curl.http](./curl.http) is used in conjuction with the Visual Studio Code [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension.
>
> When you open [curl.http](./curl.http), you should see a clickable `Send Request` text above each of the URLs

![REST Client example](./images/RESTClient.png)

Clicking on `Send Request` should open a new panel in Visual Studio Code with the response from that request like so:

![REST Client example response](./images/RESTClientResponse.png)

## Jump Box

A `jump box` pod is created so that you can execute commands `in the cluster`

- use the `kj` alias
  - `kubectl exec -it jumpbox -- bash -l`
    - note: -l causes a login and processes `.profile`
    - note: `sh -l` will work, but the results will not be displayed in the terminal due to a bug
- example
  - run `kj`
    - Your terminal prompt will change
    - From the `jumpbox` terminal
    - Run `http ngsa-memory:8080/version`
    - `exit` back to the Codespaces terminal

- use the `kje` alias
  - `kubectl exec -it jumpbox --`
- example
  - run http against the ClusterIP
    - `kje http ngsa-memory:8080/version`

- Since the jumpbox is running `in` the cluster, we use the service name and port, not the NodePort
  - A jumpbox is great for debugging network issues

## NodePorts

- Codespaces exposes `ports` to the browser
- We take advantage of this by exposing `NodePort` on most of our K8s services
- Codespaces ports are setup in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file

- Exposing the ports

  ```json

  // forward ports for the app
  "forwardPorts": [
    30000,
    30080,
    30088,
    32000
  ],

  ```

- Adding labels to the ports

  ```json

  // add labels
  "portsAttributes": {
    "30000": { "label": "Prometheus" },
    "30080": { "label": "ngsa-app" },
    "30088": { "label": "WebV" },
    "32000": { "label": "Grafana" },
  },

  ```

## View NGSA App

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the ngsa-app port (30080)
- This will open the ngsa-app home page (Swagger) in a new browser tab

## View Web Validate

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the WebV port (30088)
- This will open the Web Validate in a new browser tab
  - Note that you will get a 404 as WebV does not have a home page
  - Add `version` or `metrics` to the end of the URL in the browser tab

## Build and deploy a local version of ngsa-memory

- We have a local Docker container registry running in the Codespace
  - Run `docker ps` to see the running images
- Build the WebAPI app from the local source code
- Push to the local Docker registry
- Deploy to local k3d cluster

- Switch back to your Codespaces tab

  ```bash

  # from Codespaces terminal

  # make and deploy a local version of ngsa-memory to k8s
  make app

  # check the app version
  # the semver will have the current date and time
  http localhost:30080/version

  ```
  
## View Prometheus Dashboard

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Prometheus port (30000)
- This will open Prometheus in a new browser tab

- From the Prometheus tab
  - Begin typing `NgsaAppDuration_bucket` in the `Expression` search
  - Click `Execute`
  - This will display the `histogram` that Grafana uses for the charts

## View Grafana Dashboard

- Grafana login info
  - admin
  - cse-labs

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
  - Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Grafana port (32000)
  - This will open Grafana in a new browser tab

![Codespace Ports](./images/CodespacePorts.jpg)

## Grafana Dashboard

![Grafana](./images/ngsa-requests-by-mode.png)

## Run integration and load tests

```bash

# from Codespaces terminal

# run an integration test (will generate warnings in Grafana)
make test

# run a 60 second load test
make load-test

```

- Switch to the Grafana brower tab
- The integration test generates 400 and 404 results by design
- The requests metric will go from green to yellow to red as load increases
  - It may skip yellow
- As the test completes
  - The metric will go back to green (10 req/sec)
  - The request graph will return to normal

![Load Test](./images/test-with-errors-and-load-test.png)

## View Fluent Bit Logs

> Fluent Bit is set to forward logs to stdout for debugging
>
> Fluent Bit can be configured to forward to different services including Azure Log Analytics

- Start `k9s` from the Codespace terminal
- Press `0` to show all `namespaces`
- Select `fluentbit` and press `enter`
- Press `enter` again to see the logs
- Press `s` to Toggle AutoScroll
- Press `w` to Toggle Wrap
- Review logs that will be sent to Log Analytics when configured
  - See `deploy/loganalytics` for directions

## Next Steps

> [Makefile](./Makefile) is a good place to start exploring

We use the `makefile` to encapsulate and document common tasks

## FAQ

- Why don't we use helm to deploy Kubernetes manifests?
  - The target audience for this repository is app developers so we chose simplicity for the Developer Experience.
  - In our daily work, we use Helm for deployments and it is installed in the `Codespace` should you want to use it.
- Why `k3d` instead of `Kind`?
  - We love kind! Most of our code will run unchanged in kind (except the cluster commands)
  - We had to choose one or the other as we don't have the resources to validate both
  - We chose k3d for these main reasons
    - Smaller memory footprint
    - Faster startup time
    - Secure by default
      - K3s supports the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/security/hardening_guide/)
    - Based on [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) which is a certified Kubernetes distro
      - Many customers run K3s on the edge as well as in CI-CD pipelines
    - Rancher provides support - including 24x7 (for a fee)
    - K3s has a vibrant community
    - K3s is a CNCF sandbox project
